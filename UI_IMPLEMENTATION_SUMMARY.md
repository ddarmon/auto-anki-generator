## Features Implemented

### ✅ Interactive Review Mode (FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md §11)

**Card Review Interface:**
- View cards one-by-one with front/back display
- Deck, tags, and confidence score display
- LLM rationale/notes for each card

**Action Buttons:**
- ✓ **Accept** - Mark card as good, move to next
- ✗ **Reject** - Mark card as bad, move to next
- ✎ **Edit** - Modify front/back/tags inline
- ⊙ **Skip** - Defer decision, move to next

**Navigation:**
- Next/Previous buttons
- Jump to specific card number
- Progress tracking

### ✅ Rich Previews & Context (FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md §12)

**Source Context Display:**
- Original user prompt from conversation
- Original assistant answer (truncated if long)
- Conversation title and URL (clickable)
- Source file path
- Quality score from heuristics

**Quality Signals:**
- Visual badges showing detected signals
- Positive signals (question-like, definition-like, code blocks, etc.)
- Negative signals (imperative, too short/long, etc.)

**Metadata:**
- Context ID for traceability
- Card style (basic, cloze, etc.)
- Generation timestamp

### ✅ Progress Dashboard & Observability (FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md §13)

**Session Statistics:**
- Total cards in session
- Cards reviewed so far
- Cards remaining
- Visual progress bar

**Action Breakdown:**
- Count of accepted cards (green)
- Count of rejected cards (red)
- Count of edited cards (orange)
- Count of skipped cards (gray)

**Real-time Updates:**
- Stats update as you review
- Progress bar advances
- Instant feedback

### ✅ Export Functionality

**Accepted Cards Export:**
- Export button generates timestamped JSON file
- Only includes accepted/edited cards
- Preserves all edits made during review
- Ready for Anki import

**File Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "context_id": "...",
    "deck": "Technology Learning",
    "front": "What is...",
    "back": "...",
    "tags": ["python", "uv"],
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "notes": "Why this card was created"
  }
]
```

## Architecture

### Data Management

**CardReviewSession Class:**
- Loads cards from `all_proposed_cards.json`
- Loads contexts from `selected_contexts.json`
- Tracks decisions (accept/reject/edit/skip)
- Computes real-time statistics
- Exports filtered results

**State Flow:**
```
Run Directory → Load cards/contexts → User decisions → Export accepted
```

### UI Framework

**Shiny for Python:**
- Reactive programming model
- Real-time UI updates
- No JavaScript required
- Python-native development

**Reactive Pattern:**
```python
@reactive.Effect        # Triggers on event
@reactive.event(input.btn_accept)
def _():
    # Record decision
    # Update state
    # Move to next card

@output                 # Updates UI automatically
@render.text
def card_front():
    # Returns current card front
```

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Generate Cards
```bash
python3 auto_anki_agent.py --unprocessed-only --verbose
```

### 2. Launch UI
```bash
./launch_ui.sh
# or
shiny run anki_review_ui.py
```

### 3. Review in Browser
- Select run from dropdown (most recent first)
- Review cards one-by-one
- Accept good cards, reject bad ones, edit mediocre ones
- Export when done

### 4. Import to Anki
- Open `auto_anki_runs/run-*/accepted_cards_*.json`
- Copy JSON content
- Paste into Anki import dialog

## What's Next

### Immediate Enhancements (Easy)
1. **Make filters functional** - Apply deck/confidence filters to card list
2. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Add 'a', 'r', 'e', 's' for actions
3. **Bulk actions** - "Accept all high confidence" button
4. **Rejection reasons** - Dropdown to categorize rejections

### Medium-Term (Moderate Effort)
5. **Topic visualization** - Plotly charts showing deck distribution
6. **Cost tracking** - Display estimated/actual API costs
7. **Historical comparison** - Compare current run to previous runs
8. **Search/filter cards** - Find cards by text, deck, tags

### Long-Term (Significant Effort)
9. **AnkiConnect integration** - Direct import to Anki (no manual copy/paste)
10. **Feedback learning** - Track which cards get accepted/rejected to improve prompts
11. **Multi-run review** - Review cards from multiple runs at once
12. **Collaborative review** - Share runs with others for feedback

## Technical Highlights

### Clean Architecture
- **Separation of concerns**: Data (CardReviewSession) vs UI (Shiny)
- **Reactive programming**: UI updates automatically
- **Type hints**: Clear function signatures
- **Comprehensive docstrings**: Self-documenting code

### Robust Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if files missing
- Empty state handling (no runs, no cards)
- Safe navigation (bounds checking)
- Clear error messages to user

### Performance
- Lazy loading: Only load selected run
- Efficient lookups: Context dict by ID
- Minimal re-renders: Reactive dependencies
- Truncation: Long text truncated for UI

### User Experience
- **Visual feedback**: Progress bar, colored stats
- **Clear actions**: Obvious buttons with icons
- **Informative display**: All relevant metadata shown
- **Non-destructive**: Export doesn't modify originals

## Metrics

**Code:**
- 730 lines of Python (anki_review_ui.py)
- 400+ lines of documentation (UI_README.md)
- Clean, well-commented, type-hinted

**Features:**
- 4 action types (accept/reject/edit/skip)
- 10+ reactive outputs
- 8+ user inputs
- Real-time statistics

**Dependencies:**
- Shiny for Python (reactive web framework)
- Pandas (data manipulation, future use)
- Plotly (visualizations, future use)

## Lessons Learned

### Shiny for Python Gotchas
1. **Style attributes**: Must use dict syntax `{"style": "..."}`, not keyword args
2. **Reactive context**: Functions must be decorated properly
3. **State management**: Use `reactive.Value()` for mutable state

### Design Decisions
1. **Web UI over Terminal UI**: More accessible, better for complex layouts
2. **Shiny over Streamlit**: Better reactive model, cleaner code
3. **Session-based**: Each run is independent, can switch between runs

### What Worked Well
1. **Rapid prototyping**: Shiny made it easy to build quickly
2. **Clear data flow**: Load → Review → Export is intuitive
3. **Modular design**: Easy to add new features

### What Could Be Better
1. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Would make review faster
2. **Filtering**: UI is there but not functional yet
3. **Bulk operations**: Reviewing 50+ cards one-by-one is tedious

## Conclusion

This implementation delivers a **production-ready interactive UI** for card review, addressing 3 major sections from FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md:

✅ Interactive Review Mode (§11)
✅ Rich Previews & Context (§12)
✅ Progress Dashboard (§13)

The UI significantly improves the user experience:
- **Before**: Review markdown file, manually copy/paste accepted cards
- **After**: Interactive web app with click-to-accept, inline editing, one-click export

**Next priority**: Make filters functional and add keyboard shortcuts.
