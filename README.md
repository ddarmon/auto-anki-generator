# Auto Anki Agent

This repository contains the Auto Anki Agent, an agentic pipeline that
turns ChatGPT conversations into high‑quality Anki cards and provides a
review UI with direct AnkiConnect integration.

Most documentation now lives under the `docs/` directory:

-   `docs/README_AUTO_ANKI.md` -- main usage guide
-   `docs/QUICK_START.md` -- quick commands to get going
-   `docs/INSTALL.md` -- installation notes
-   `docs/START_HERE.md` -- orientation for new contributors
-   `docs/FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` -- roadmap and design notes
-   `docs/CLAUDE.md` -- assistant/developer guide

The core Python package lives under `auto_anki/` and the original
monolithic script is still available as `auto_anki_agent.py` for
backwards compatibility.
